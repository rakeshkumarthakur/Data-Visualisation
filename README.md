# 📊 Data Visualization in Python — End-to-End Analytical Project  
This repository contains a complete end-to-end data visualization project showcasing how raw datasets can be transformed into analytical insights using Python. The project focuses on cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), computing descriptive statistics, and generating visual outputs that reveal trends, distributions, relationships, and correlations within the dataset. The workflow is implemented through a reproducible Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates modern data visualization techniques relevant for data science, research, and business intelligence applications.

The project begins by importing one or more structured datasets (CSV/XLSX) into Pandas DataFrames. The notebook performs initial inspections (shape, datatypes, missing values, outliers), followed by preprocessing steps such as imputing missing values, converting data types, standardizing column formats, and filtering invalid entries. Once the dataset is prepared, exploratory analysis is conducted to understand statistical properties through summary metrics including mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, enabling a strong numerical understanding of the dataset prior to visualization.

Visual analytics form the core of the notebook. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project generates multiple forms of statistical and comparative charts including histograms to study distributions, box and violin plots to analyze spread and outliers, bar and line charts for temporal or categorical trends, correlation heatmaps to evaluate variable relationships, scatterplots for bivariate dependencies, pairplots for multivariate pattern detection, and density plots for continuous variable profiling. Optional Plotly integration adds interactive support enabling zooming, filtering, and hovering controls for enhanced exploratory workflows, making the notebook suitable for web-based dashboards or BI applications.

From a project standpoint, this repository is structured for clarity and reuse. The `datasets/` directory stores raw or updated data files, while `outputs/` contains exported charts and visual reports for documentation or presentation purposes. The core notebook (`Data Visualisation.ipynb`) documents all transformation and visualization steps with code and inline explanations so analysts can reproduce the workflow. Users can update or replace datasets without modifying logic, provided schema compatibility is maintained, which makes the project adaptable for multiple domains including finance, automotive, healthcare, marketing, policy research, or academic coursework.

This project is valuable for students learning EDA, analysts conducting reporting work, researchers validating hypotheses, and business teams requiring visualization for decision support. The repository demonstrates how visualization can uncover insights not visible in raw tables, such as hidden correlations, group-level differences, seasonality effects, and distribution anomalies. The workflow can easily be extended to dashboards, data pipelines, or statistical modeling projects.
